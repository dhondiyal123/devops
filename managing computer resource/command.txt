-----------------request quota----------------

create a file podresources.yml by providing the request and limit 
apply this podresources.yml
#kubectl describe pod resources

now create resourcequota.yml  this is an object 

now create a pod testpod.yml by specifing the 
 resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "200m"
we have requested 200m cpu for this deploymnet object 

it will not create the pod beacuse in resourcequota.yml we have set the limit of 400m but in testpod.yml 
we have created 3 replica of 200m 200*3=600 each so that is greater then set limit which is 400m.

#kubectl describe rs (rsname)

now create a cupdefault.yml 
 now this will create the pod beacuse we have requested the 200m cpu in testpod.yml 
----------------

now if we have defined the limit but not request in cpu2.yml so 
limit=request

#kubectl describe pod (podname)

now if we have define the request but not defined the limit cpu3.yml
limit=default {1=default}
